            <p>Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used without our prior written consent. All other trademarks appearing in our applications are the property of their respective owners.</p>

            <h2>Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)</h2>

            <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL NEXUS APPS, ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, OR AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION:</p>

            <ul>

            <h2>Updates and Modifications</h2>
            <p>We may update the applications from time to time. Updates may be required to continue using the applications. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the applications at any time without notice.</p>

            <h2>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>
            <p>Any dispute arising from these Terms or the applications shall be resolved through binding arbitration rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if they qualify. You waive any right to a jury trial or to participate in a class action.</p>

            <h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
            <p>These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Nexus Apps regarding the applications and supersede all prior agreements.</p>

            <h2>Waiver</h2>
            <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>Your continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms. If you do not agree to changes, you must stop using the applications.</p>

            <h2>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the state in which our business is located, without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>
